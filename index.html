            I am a computer scientist and software engineer. Usually I work on problems
            in security and privacy, though my work intersects with
            programming languages (formal verification, logic programming, type systems,
            compilers, static analysis, and language design), computer hardware (computer architecture,
            electronic design automation, and hardware implementation)
            and computer systems (operating systems, blockchain). I do both
            experiment-driven systems-building research as well as theoretical work. 
            I have published research in top-tier venues for all of these domains
            (CCS, SOSP, ASPLOS, HPCA, ICCAD), and brought
            research to production at Google. I have experience working
            in industrial research labs, R&D for a small software startup,
            and a production computer hardware team.
            I have been programming for over 20 years, and doing research
            in security and privacy for 12 years.
            I have a PhD in Electrical and Computer
            Engineering from Cornell University, where I won the department's
            best dissertation award.

    Currently, I am a researcher employed in the research and development department
    of <a href="https://www.certora.com/">Certora</a>, where I work on formal verification
    of smart contracts.
    </p>

    <p>
    Previously I was a Research Scientist at <a href="https://research.google/">
    Google Research</a>, where I developed privacy preserving technologies.
    My projects included: developing tools and theoretical foundations for
    formal verification of commercial hypervisors; designing and verifying
    an information flow control runtime with formal security guarantees;
    developing a declarative, logic-based privacy policy language;
    contributing to a dataflow analysis framework specialized for privacy use-cases;
    and collaborating on static analyses for differential privacy.

    Before that, I was a Hardware Engineer at Google (on a different team),
    ensuring Google smartphones are resilient to physical attacks. In particular,
    I developed mitigations for power side channel attacks, and explored formal methods
    tools that could provide formal security guarantees such as T-Probing Security.
    </p>
    
    <p>
    At Microsoft Research, I collaborated on
    <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/komodo/">Komodo</a>
    a formally verified 
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trusted_execution_environment">
    Trusted Execution Environment</a> (also called an "enclave") with machine-checked
    proofs of correctness and comprehensive information flow security theorems.
    </p>

    As a PhD student at Cornell, I won the department's Best Dissertation Award
    for my research combinging programming languages and computer architecture
    techniques to prevent timing channel attacks.
    This work began
    5 years before Spectre/Meltdown drew significant attention to this problem.
    My research entailed both novel computer archtiectures to mitigate these
    attacks, and programming language tools that ensure hardware designs
    are not vulnerable to timing channels. In particular I developed novel 
    microarchitectures for caches, microcontrollers, and full processors that
    coordinate scheduling to achieve high performance while still preventing these
    attacks. I also developed a hardware description language equipped with
    an information flow type system that efficiently proves the hardware 
    has a timing-sensitive variant of noninterference. It supports dependant types
    that can express functional correctness conditions that are dispatched to
    an SMT solver.
    </p>

    <p>
    As an undergraduate researcher at the University of Connecticut, I worked on
    novel techniques for detecting hardware trojan attacks which are attacks
    on computer hardware supply chains, for example, when nation-state actors
    compromise a hardware fabrication facility.
